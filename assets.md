# Assets

Docweaver supports documentation assets (doc assets). These assets are made public and may be referenced from key points in the documentation. 

**NB**: This feature requires that your applications public storage directory is linked and assessible via the browser. See: https://laravel.com/docs/5.5/filesystem

Supported asset directories:
- `/images`

Areas where doc assets can be used:
- meta file (`.docweaver.yml`)
